# MAP REDUCE USING APACHE GORA

THOORI
***

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key value stores, document stores, distributed in-memory key/value stores, in-memory data grids, in-memory caches, distributed multi-model stores, and hybrid in-memory architectures.

Gora also enables analysis of data with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce.

## FEATURES OF GORA

* **Data Persistence** : Persisting objects to Column stores such as Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, Hypertable; key-value stores such as Voldermort, Redis, etc; SQL databases, such as MySQL, HSQLDB, flat files in local file system of Hadoop HDFS;
* **Data Access** : An easy to use Java-friendly common API for accessing the data regardless of its location;
* **Indexing** : Persisting objects to Apache Lucene and Apache Solr indexes, accessing/querying the data with Gora API;
* **Analysis** : Accesing the data and making analysis through adapters for Apache Pig, Apache Hive and Cascading;
* **MapReduce support** : Out-of-the-box and extensive MapReduce (Apache Hadoop) support for data in the data store.
