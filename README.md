# MAP REDUCE USING APACHE GORA

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key value stores, document stores, distributed in-memory key/value stores, in-memory data grids, in-memory caches, distributed multi-model stores, and hybrid in-memory architectures.

Gora also enables analysis of data with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce.

## FEATURES OF GORA

* **Data Persistence** : Persisting objects to Column stores such as Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, Hypertable; key-value stores such as Voldermort, Redis, etc; SQL databases, such as MySQL, HSQLDB, flat files in local file system of Hadoop HDFS;
* **Data Access** : An easy to use Java-friendly common API for accessing the data regardless of its location;
* **Indexing** : Persisting objects to Apache Lucene and Apache Solr indexes, accessing/querying the data with Gora API;
* **Analysis** : Accesing the data and making analysis through adapters for Apache Pig, Apache Hive and Cascading;
* **MapReduce support** : Out-of-the-box and extensive MapReduce (Apache Hadoop) support for data in the data store.

## BACKGROUND

ORM stands for Object Relation Mapping. It is a technology which abstacts the persistency layer (mostly Relational Databases) so that plain domain level objects can be used, without the cumbersome effort to save/load the data to and from the database.


## WHO IS GORA FOR ?

* Hands on Developers required to deal with data volumes which justify Big Data storage solutions classified under NoSQL platform.
* Developers who seek a Java friendly(REST- style) **API** for mapping Java objects to and from NoSQL technologies.
* Gora is simple since it ignores complex SQL mappings.
* Developers seeking extensive support for Map-Reducing data and mapping the data store.
* Indexing and Persisting support to Column/Key-Value store.
